# Vector Algebra – Basic Properties

## 1. Commutative Law of Addition
a + b = b + a  
- The order of addition does not matter.

## 2. Associative Law of Addition
(a + b) + c = a + (b + c) = a + b + c  
- Grouping of vectors does not affect the result.

## 3. Distributive Law of Scalar Multiplication
k(a + b) = ka + kb  
- A scalar multiplies each vector inside the brackets.

### Summary
- Commutative → order doesn’t matter  
- Associative → grouping doesn’t matter  
- Distributive → scalar distributes across addition
